We no longer talk. Oh was this something that happened because of an argument?\n",

I would go with the bigfoot option. You can get a costume on the cheap on ebay nowadays. I've used that tactic countless times and it has never failed!\n",

I don't know I was new to driving and hadn't experienced anything like that. I felt like my horn made him swerve into the water barrels.\n",
